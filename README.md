                                Analytics Modeling - ISYE 6501 offered at Georgia Tech is an introduction to descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytical modeling. 
                                There are a wide variety of topics covered including classification, clustering, change detection, data smoothing, validation, prediction, optimization, experimentation, decision making and others.

                                Given a business problem, I feel confident in my ability to translate that into an analytics-based problem and select an appropriate analytics-based solution as well as building a preliminary solution in R. 
                                I also feel quite comfortable with evaluating someone elses analytics-based solution and determining whether the conclusion made was reasonable or not.

                                Perhaps most important for any data practitioner is the ability to think critically and problem-solve.
                                This course lays the groundwork for what kinds of tools are available to use for us analytics professionals and how to use each appropriately and effectively.
